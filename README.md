ZacRuns is a student project @ Avenues: The World School. It addresses the following. 

"A mini project for students to create quickly and have for Git and GitHub practice.

The game has a moving background, a character that moves up and down with either the mouse or the keys, and an obstacle which repeatedly comes at the character. The game should end when the obstacle collides with the character.

It is intended that students work in groups of 3 so that each may work on one of the files (background.js, character.js, and obstacle.js). After merging work through Git on GitHub, students will need to work together to redesign code for collision detection."
